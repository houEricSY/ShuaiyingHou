I was tasked with overseeing the human segmentation algorithm module within the company’s "Smart Canteen" project. This module was successfully integrated into the company’s product ecosystem, while the underlying algorithm was further refined and deployed to the cloud—facilitating its official demonstration on the company’s official website.
Additionally, I served as a core member in the company’s virtual human project, with primary responsibility for the research and development of algorithms pertaining to human motion generation. The resulting technical outcomes contributed to the optimization of the company’s motion capture system and were incorporated into products as the foundational framework for subsequent virtual human motion generation algorithms.
